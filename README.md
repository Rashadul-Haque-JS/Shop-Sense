This is a hobby project that I have recently started and there is still much more to come.

"Expense Cutter" is a web application aimed at assisting users in reducing excessive spending while traveling by keeping track of the weight of their shopping items. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to effortlessly monitor the weight of their purchases, empowering them to make informed decisions and effectively manage their expenses. 

Stay tuned for exciting updates and enhancements as I continue to develop and refine this project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

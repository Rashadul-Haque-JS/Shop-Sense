        <span className='italic'>Shop Sense</span> is an application designed to solve common problems faced by
        travelers during air travel. Many people often end up buying more than
        they are allowed to carry free of charge, leading to situations where
        they have to pay extra charges for overweight luggage or dispose of
        their purchases.
